# ML-ImageHash

A PyTorch implementation of a machine learning perceptual image hash algorithm for near-duplicate detection and fast content-based image retrieval.

Introduces an algorithm which improves upon Triplet Margin Loss as introduced by the FaceNet paper: <https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832>
